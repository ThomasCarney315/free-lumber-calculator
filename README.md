# free-lumber-calculator

### What 
- A web application with the purpose of providing a template to input lumber dimensions and pricing that is automatically calculated into accurate volumes, prices, and totals. I designed it in a format that can be easily used for invoiving and record keeping.

### Why
- I built this application to provide value to people who could benefit from it for free.
### How
- I utilized an excellent free template from HTML5 UP to start with. With modifiactions to CSS and HTML I  was able to add a table for which I based my Javascript web application. I then wrote some functional JS to accomplish the maths and DOM manipulation for the lumber calculator.
### Future
- I will revist this and refactor it with DRY and OOP best practices as well as adding some further functionality.
- PDF creaton from table data
- Saving progress of table data on page 
- Abiltiy to add rows on demand
