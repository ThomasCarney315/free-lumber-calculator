# free-lumber-calculator

- What: This is a basic web application with the purpose of providing a template to input lumber dimensions and pricing that is automatically calculated into accurate volumes, prices, and totals. I designed it in a format that can be easily used for invoiving and record keeping.

- Why: I built this application for practice while also being able to provide value to people who could benefit from it for free.

- How: I utilized an excellent free template from HTML5 UP to start with. With miniaml modifiactions to css and html I  was able to add a table for which I based my Javascript web application. I then wrote some functional JS to accomplish the maths and DOM manipulation for the lumber calculator.

     I would like to revist this and refactor it with DRY and OOP best practices as well as adding some further functionality once a I have learned those skills.
